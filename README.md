Model Accuracy

🔬 Approach

Data Preprocessing:

One-hot encoding of categorical variables (Sex, BP, Cholesterol).

Feature scaling using StandardScaler.

Model: Logistic Regression (max_iter=1000, random_state=42).

Evaluation: Accuracy on test set.

📊 Example Output
Accuracy: 0.85


(Actual accuracy may vary based on train-test split.)

📌 Dataset

The dataset contains medical records with the following features:

Age: Age of the patient

Sex: Male / Female

BP: Blood pressure level (Low, Normal, High)

Cholesterol: Cholesterol level (Normal, High)

Na_to_K: Sodium-to-potassium ratio

Drug: Target variable (Drug type)
